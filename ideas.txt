Dialogue System Ideas
=====================
3 Scores
- Relation - How much they like you. Affects what they say to you.
- Familiarity - How well they know you. It's the sum of your spent points with them.
- Interest - How much they want to talk to you right now. A currency you spend on dialogue options. Increases over time.

Improved Dialogue Manager & Interactions
- Improved NPC interactions with player
- Rare Events
- Room for Player Input
- NPC's should react to player stats like class, level, haircut, purchasing history, retreats from combat, combat victories, etc. . .

Stats to store:
- # of Combats
- List of all enemy types killed
- # of Retreats

- unique stats per NPC
- # of times talked to that NPC
- variables for controlling unique dialogue events (ie to prevent dialogue from repeating)

New Classes
===========
- Duelist: +2 WEP +1 DEX. Start with a Scimitar and a Buckler. Attacks have +10% hit chance and +10% damage, but you can only attack 1 unique enemy per turn.
- Monk: +2 VIT. Start with a quarterstaff and a Plain Cassock. Each turn, heal the lowest HP ally in your row 10% of your Max HP. You can rest at the church to recover HP. The first time you die, wake up at the church with 1 HP.
- Merchant: 1 END. 1 AVD. Start with 50 gold and a backpack, but no weapon. You can sell items for 100% of their value rather than 50%, however you can't drop any items.

- Alchemist: something with potions
- Druid: Transform into an animal (?)
- Psychic: 
- Brawler
- Servant, has an NPC noble
